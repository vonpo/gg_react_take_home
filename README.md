## User stories

- As a user, I want to be able to see and browse through a list of all of the trending GIFs so that I can be inspired to use a GIF I have never used before
- As a user, I want to be able to search for a specific GIF that I am looking for so that I can find the perfect GIF to send to my friends
- As a user, I want to be able to expand the details of one of the GIFs that I found so that I can see all of the relevant details and also decide if I want to use it to send to my friends
    - Feel free to use whatever details you think are important
- As a user, I want to be able to mark specific GIFs that I like as my favorites so that I can always come back to my favorite GIFs rather than having to search for them again.
- As a user, I want to be able to refresh the page or come back to it at a later date and still see my favorite GIFs
    - This does not require the GIPHY API or any backend API. Just store this locally on the front-end.
